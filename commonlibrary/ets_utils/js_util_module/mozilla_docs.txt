The definitions of some interfaces implemented in jsapi/api/js_url.cpp are released under Mozilla license.

The definitions and functions of these interfaces are consistent with the standard interfaces under mozilla license,
but the implementation of specific functions is independent and self-developed. 

All interfaces are described in d.ts, the following is the interface written in d.ts under to Mozilla license

class TextDecoder {
    readonly encoding: string;
    readonly fatal: boolean;
    readonly ignoreBOM = false;
    constructor(
        encoding?: string,
        options?: { fatal?: boolean; ignoreBOM?: boolean },
    );
    decode(input: Uint8Array, options?: { stream?: false }): string;
}

class TextEncoder {

    readonly encoding = "utf-8";
    constructor();
    encode(input?: string): Uint8Array;
    encodeInto(
        input: string,
        dest: Uint8Array,
    ): { read: number; written: number };
}
