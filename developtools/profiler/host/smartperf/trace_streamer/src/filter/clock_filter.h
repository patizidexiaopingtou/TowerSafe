 * TS_REALTIME:  A settable system-wide clock that measures real time. Its time represents seconds and nanoseconds

 * TS_MONOTONIC:  The number of seconds that the system has been running since it was booted.The CLOCK_MONOTONIC
 * clock is not affected by discontinuous jumps in the system time ï¼Œbut is affected by the incremental adjustments
 * performed by adjtime(3) and  NTP. This clock does not count time that the system is  suspended.
 * TS_MONOTONIC_COARSE:  A faster but less precise version of TS_MONOTONIC.
 * TS_MONOTONIC_RAW:  Similar to TS_MONOTONIC, but provides access to a raw  hardware-based time that is not subject
 * to NTP adjustments or the incremental adjustments performed by adjtime(3). This clock does not count time that the
 * system is suspended.
 * TS_BOOTTIME:  A nonsettable system-wide clock that is identical to TS_MONOTONIC, except that it also includes
 * any time that the system is suspended.
